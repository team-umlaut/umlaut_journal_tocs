        class=\"paragraphSection\"&gt;A house erected in accord with modern science
        and the builder&#8217;s art must satisfy a few apparently simple needs. These
        have been cleverly summarized in the following words: protection from the
        elements, from cold and heat, from rain and snow and damp, from intruders
        who might interfere with the family safety or possessions; water at hand;
        some way of getting rid of waste; space for the family, for all their occupations
        and belongings; room for a guest: these were sought by even the cave dwellers.
        And we have not passed beyond these simple needs. Our enemies are of a different
        kind, but the daily paper shows that we must pay for safety locks; and while
        wild animals no longer prowl about, we find it almost impossible to keep out
        rats and mice and harmful insects. The &#8220;house&#8221; fly is now called
        a &#8220;typhoid&#8221; fly, and not permitted even as a casual visitor. To
        all these needs we have added what the cave man did not seek for, since his
        life was largely out of doors. We must have air and sun within doors. Doctors
        are now talking about house diseases. Tuberculosis is one of these, and the
        fight against it must be made, in part, just here. It is for sun and air that
        we have to pay large rents in town; and it is partly to secure these in our
        large dwellings that tenement-house commissions exist, to protect those who
        cannot protect themselves. Then, too, there must be protection against fire,
        not only by the fire department but also in the house itself. Modern nerves,
        moreover, demand quiet. We may want our own phonograph, but we do not care
        to hear our neighbor&#8217;s, and walls and floors must be built to keep out
        sounds. We call these simple needs. They would seem to be human rights; but
        even now, in this twentieth century, how many houses rank 100 per cent. in
        all these: in warmth and coolness at proper seasons; perfect dryness, ventilation
        and lighting; safety from fire and intruders; and room for each member of
        the family to be by himself, and to keep an open door to guests&#39; Yet,
        we cannot be as well or as happy or as useful as we should, until these are
        achieved.&lt;/span&gt;</description>\r\n<dc:identifier>http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=2429702</dc:identifier>\r\n<dc:publisher>American

        class=\"paragraphSection\"&gt;Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a heterogeneous
        disease, both with respect to molecular pathogenesis and clinical outcome.
        Although dose-intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation
        have improved outcomes in AML, there remains significant heterogeneity in
        clinical outcome such that approximately 20% of patients are cured with existing
        therapies, 20% have therapy-refractory disease from the time of diagnosis,
        and 50% relapse and die from refractory disease after an initial response

        identify which patients will have a substantive chance of cure, and which
        patients will likely relapse or present with refractory disease. Current standard
        of care uses clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular factors for risk stratification;

        class=\"paragraphSection\"&gt;Loss of cognitive function and the development

        to 65.7 million in 2030, and 115.4 million in 2050. In the United States in

        One of the most common differential diagnoses is foreign body granuloma. These

        can be differentiated by the presence of foreign bodies. Generally, reactions

        class=\"paragraphSection\"&gt;When I started medical school, I received a
        lot of (mostly unsolicited) advice on various topics, ranging from specialty
        choice to the importance of keeping work-life balance to how to befriend nurses
        in order to get things done.  I would listen passively while friends and family
        blathered on about how comfortable their subspecialists&#8217; lifestyles
        were.  One recurring theme that I actively paid attention to was how often
        people advised me to avoid becoming &#8220;one of those&#8221; doctors who
        distanced themselves from their patients. I didn&#8217;t quite understand
        why some people could ever view physicians to be uncaring, cold, and callous,
        and why physicians allowed themselves to be perceived as such. Medicine is
        still the noblest of professions, and one would expect altruism as a baseline
        for all who go into the field. Personally, I was able to hold on tightly to
        my humanity and positive attitude throughout the preclinical years of medical
        school without issue. I even received high marks for compassion and empathy
        in our &#8220;doctoring&#8221; courses. At that point in my training I continued
        to feel as though I were above falling victim to the fate of the heartless
        physician. So why, I wondered in my short, unwrinkled, and as yet unblemished
        white coat, were some physicians so detached from their patients&#39; Once
        the clinical years started, I quickly discovered the answer.&lt;/span&gt;</description>\r\n<dc:identifier>http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=2429718</dc:identifier>\r\n<dc:creator>Dempsey

        received a lot of (mostly unsolicited) advice on various topics, ranging from
        specialty choice to the importance of keeping work-life balance to how to
        befriend nurses in order to get things done.  I would listen passively while
        friends and family blathered on about how comfortable their subspecialists&#8217;
        lifestyles were.  One recurring theme that I actively paid attention to was
        how often people advised me to avoid becoming &#8220;one of those&#8221; doctors
        who distanced themselves from their patients. I didn&#8217;t quite understand
        why some people could ever view physicians to be uncaring, cold, and callous,
        and why physicians allowed themselves to be perceived as such. Medicine is
        still the noblest of professions, and one would expect altruism as a baseline
        for all who go into the field. Personally, I was able to hold on tightly to
        my humanity and positive attitude throughout the preclinical years of medical
        school without issue. I even received high marks for compassion and empathy
        in our &#8220;doctoring&#8221; courses. At that point in my training I continued
        to feel as though I were above falling victim to the fate of the heartless
        physician. So why, I wondered in my short, unwrinkled, and as yet unblemished
        white coat, were some physicians so detached from their patients&#39; Once
        the clinical years started, I quickly discovered the answer.&lt;/span&gt;</p>]]></content:encoded>\r\n</item>\n\r\n\t\r\n
